 <h3>Errata</h3>
 <h4>Homework 7, Question 3 (b) i.:</h4>
 <p>The solution to this question in the back of Boyce has a typo. It should
 read
 $$ F(s) = \frac{2e^{-2s}}{s^3} $$
 (the answer as it's given in Boyce omits the \(2\) in the exponent).</p>

 <h4>Homework 7, Question 3 (c) i.:</h4>
 <p>I mistranscribed the function \(F(s)\) when copying it across from Boyce
 6.3 Q20. I initially had written \(F(s) = \frac{e^{-2s}}{s^2+s+2}\); 
 the function should read
 $$ F(s) = \frac{e^{-2s}}{s^2+s-2} $$
 i.e. a minus sign in the denominator. I've updated the Homework 7 PDF with
 this correction.</p>

 <h4>Homework 6, Question 4 (b):</h4>
 <p>There is an error in the solution given in Boyce to this problem (this
 question corresponds to Boyce 3.8 Q8 (a). The solution given is
 $$y = \frac{1}{153281} \left[ 160 e^{-5t}\cos\left(\sqrt{73}\, t\right) 
 + \frac{383443}{7300}e^{-5t}\sin\left(\sqrt{73}\, t\right) 
 - 160\cos\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) + 3128\sin\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) \right]
 $$
 The solution <b>should</b> read
 $$\begin{aligned}
 y = \frac{1}{153281} &\left[160e^{-5t}\cos\left(\sqrt{73}\, t\right)
 + \frac{383443\sqrt{73}}{7300}e^{-5t}\sin\left(\sqrt{73}\, t\right) \right. \\
 & \;\;\;\left.- 160\cos\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) + 3128\sin\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) \right]
 \end{aligned}$$
 i.e. with an extra factor of \(\sqrt{73}\) in the 
 \(e^{-5t}\sin(\sqrt{73}\, t)\) term. Everything else in the given solution
 is correct.
 </p>

 <h4>Homework 4:</h4>
 <p>The homework set printout I handed out in class has multiple typos (again).
 <ul>
 <li> Question 1 (c) iii. should read
 $$y^{\prime\prime}+2y^{\prime}+2y=0,\quad y\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)=2, \
   y^{\prime}\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)=-2$$</li>
 <li> Question 2 (b) ii. is cited as coming from Boyce 3.3 Q22; it's actually
 from Boyce 3.4 Q14 </li>
 <li> Question 3 (a) ii. should read
 $$y^{\prime\prime}+2y^{\prime}+5y=3\sin(2t)$$</li>
 </ul>
 I've updated the <a href="../math307_material/homeworks/HW_4.pdf">Homework 4</a> PDF to reflect
 these corrections.</p>

 <h4>Homework 3, Question 3:</h4>
 <p>The original homework set printout I game you in class has multiple typos
 in this question. All parts of the question are taken from Boyce, and should
 read as stated in the textbook. Specifically, Question 2 (a) i. should read
 $$y^{\prime\prime}+2y^{\prime}-3y=0$$
 Question 2 (a) iii. should read
 $$y^{\prime\prime}+5y^{\prime}=0$$
 and Question 2 (b) i. should read
 $$y^{\prime\prime}+y^{\prime}-2y=0,\quad y(0)=1, y^{\prime}(0)=1$$
 I've updated the <a href="../math307_material/homeworks/HW_3.pdf">Homework 3</a> PDF to reflect
 these corrections.
 </p>

 <h4>Homework 2, Question 1 (e):</h4>
 <p>This question is lifted directly from Boyce, corresponding to question 23 of
 Section 2.3. The solutions at the back of the book assumes that you start with the
 differential equation
 $$m \frac{dv}{dt} = -mg - kg\cdot v,$$
 where \(m=180\), \(g=32\) and \(k=0.75\) and \(12\) during the freefall and
 parachute parts of the skydive respectively.</p>

 <p>It's not clear to me as to why the second term has that extra \(g\) in it: if I 
 had set up the model, I would have used \(m \frac{dv}{dt} = -mg - kv\), as I'm 
 sure many of you are attempting to do. The latter seems to make more sense to me, but 
 because they never mention what the units of the proportionality constants are it's 
 impossible to ascertain which differential equation is the more correct choice.</p>

 <p>Therefore: for this question I'll accept either set of answers as correct, so long
 as you a) state upfront which of the two differential equations you're working with,
 and b) remain consistent with your choice thereof throughout the question.</p>

 <h4>Homework 2, Question 1 (e) iv:</h4>
 <p>Here you are asked to find the total time taken for the skydiver to reach the 
 ground. In order to do so you'll end up needing to solve for \(t\) in an equation
 that looks like
 $$ t = A + Be^{-Ct} $$
 for some constants \(A,B\) and \(C\) (that you know). There is no way to solve for 
 \(t\) explicitly here, so you will have to provide an approximate answer. <br>
 Hint: note that the \(Be^{-Ct}\) term is very small compared
 to the constant \(A\) term, so your answer should be very close to \(t=A\).</p>

 <p>I've amended the question in the homework printout to reflect the above
 clarification.</p>

 <h4>Homework 1, Question 1 (c):</h4>
 <p>In this question I ask you to integrate the function
 \(\frac{x+2}{x^2+9}\) by using partial fractions and complex numbers. At some point
 you'll need to find the antiderivative of \(\frac{1}{x+3i}\).</p>

 <p>The correct antiderivative for this function is \(\ln(x+3i)\), without any absolute
 value signs. The reason why we don't need the absolute value signs here come
 down to the fact that we're taking the log of a complex number; it turns out 
 that the log of a complex number \(z\) (without absolute value signs) is unambiguously 
 the antiderivative of \(\frac{1}{z}\), so long as \(z\) isn't purely real and negative.
 This would be the case here - assuming \(x\) is real, \(x+3i\) is definitely not real
 and negative. It turns out after simplification that the answer you'll get is the 
 same as \(\frac{1}{2}\ln(x^2+9) + \frac{2}{3}\arctan(\frac{x}{3})\), which is what
 you'd get if you integrated the function in the standard way you learned in MATH125.</p> 

 <p>Don't worry, I don't expect you to know or remember all this - this is the realm of 
 graduate-level complex analysis, so is way beyond the scope of this course. For 
 the homework I'll accept the answer in the form \((\)complex number\()*\ln(x+3i)\ +\) 
  another term that looks very similar; you need not attempt to simplify beyond this 
 point. The purpose of this question is just to show you that you can employ 
 complex numbers when doing integrals, and to give you a bit of practice doing 
 arithmetic with complex numbers.</p>

 <h4>Homework Grading Scheme:</h4>

 <p>There are a total of 7 weekly homework sets for this course. The six best scores
 will be counted toward your final grade; your lowest homework score will be dropped.
 I have a strict no late submissions policy for the homework. Requests for extensions
 will only be considered if submitted in writing (i.e. handwritten note or email)
 at least two hours before the homework due date and time, and will generally only
 be given in cases of medical or physical duress.</p>

 <p>Each homework set will be graded out of 20 points. 
 Because the course grader is only employed for a maximum of
 4 hours a week, given the class size it's unfeasible to have every
 homework question graded fully. 
 Thus a few questions will be randomly selected from the homework
 each week and those will be graded fully; this usually comprises
 about 10-12 points total. The balance of the points will be awarded
 for fully completing the homework set.</p>

 <p>Hopefully this will provide decent feedback on your progress in
 the course and incentivize you to complete each homework set fully,
 given the constraints of the grader's contract.</p>
