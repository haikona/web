 <h2>MATH307A, WINTER 2014</h2>
 <br>
 <p> Hi Everyone! Welcome to MATH307a, Winter 2014. I'll use this page 
 for course announcements and to provide links to material mentioned in 
 class.</p>

 <h4>Announcements:</h4>
 <p>(2014-03-07) I've put your existing grades for MATH307 up on Catalyst 
 - you should be able to find a link under your courses on your Catalyst 
 homepage (you'll need to be logged in to your MyUW account to view them),
 or follow the link <a href="http://catalysttools.washington.edu/">here</a>.
 Please check your existing grades to see if they are correct - send me 
 an email if you spot any discrepancies.</p>

 <p>(2014-02-13) A reminder that there's no class this coming Monday
 due to the public holiday. I'll therefore be having extra office hours
 tomorrow Friday Feb 14, 13:00-15:00 in my office PDL C-430. Please try
 and look over Homework 5 before then in case you have questions you want
 to ask me, as I won't be able to answer them in person on Monday.</p>

 <p>(2014-02-08) I've fixed some typos in 
 <a href="../math307_material/homeworks/HW_4.pdf">Homework 4</a>. See the Errata section
 of the Homework tab for more info.</p>

 <p>(2014-02-05) I've put up links to <a href="../math307_material/homeworks/HW_4.pdf">
 Homework 4</a> in the the Homeworks tab and the 
 <a href="../math307_material/resources/midterm_1_wi14_spicer_solutions.pdf">Solutions to
 Midterm 1</a> in the Resources tab.</p>

 <p>(2014-02-01) I've fixed some typos in Question 3 of 
 <a href="../math307_material/homeworks/HW_3.pdf">Homework 3</a>. See the Errata section
 of the Homework tab for more info.</p>

 <p>(2014-01-31) In question 4 of the midterm I used \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) 
 in the statement of the differential equation, but talk about \(t\) 
 as the independent variable in part b). This is my error: everything 
 should be in terms of \(t\), so the differential equation should be
 $$\frac{dy}{dt} = \sin^2(y)-K$$
 My apologies if this confused anyone during the midterm. I'm raising
 the regrade point cap for question 4 to 10 points, so you can now get
 full grade for this question if your writeup is fully correct.</p>

 <p>(2014-01-31) I've put up a link to the full 
 <a href="../math307_material/resources/midterm_1_wi14_spicer.pdf">Midterm 1</a>
 script from Wednesday on the Resources tab. The linked script has all
 typos pointed out to me so far corrected, including those in Question
 4.</p>

 <p>(2014-01-31) <b>MIDTERM 1 MAKEUP GUIDELINES:</b><br>
 I'm allowing you to redo questions 4 and 5 of Midterm 1 as a take-home 
 assignment, to be handed in Monday 3 Feb at the beginning of class.
 I will grade both questions 4 and 5 out of a maximum of 10 points total. These
 scores will then replace your existing scores for those two questions (only if
 your new scores are higher; I won't ever adjust your score downwards).</p>

 <p>For each question to be eligible to be graded <b>you must write up full 
 solutions to all parts of that question</b>, not just the parts where you lost 
 points. This includes the third part of question 5; I will not regrade your 
 question 5 if you have not attempted part c). If you feel you did well enough
 on one of the questions you may of course just submit a solution to the other
 one, and you are welcome to not submit any rewrites if you are happy with your
 scores on both questions.</p>

 <p>I encourage everyone who got less than full grade on questions 4 
 and/or 5 to submit new solutions, as both problems are exercises in inferring 
 the behavior of a dynamic system through analyzing its governing differential 
 equation; this is one of the most crucial skills you should learn in this course. 
 I encourage you to collaborate and figure out the solutions in groups together; 
 however, as always please acknowledge anyone you worked with in writing at 
 the top of you writeup. Furthermore, even if you collaborate with others to 
 figure out the problem solutions <b>you must write up your solutions in your 
 own words</b>; I won't accept the exact same solution copied into multiple 
 write-ups.</p>

 <p>Finally, because this is open book with much less time pressure, I'll be 
 grading your submissions more strictly than I did for questions 4 and 5 on the 
 midterm. I urge you therefore to double-check your solutions for correctness.</p>
 
 <p>(2014-01-31) <a href="../math307_material/homeworks/HW_3.pdf">Homework 3</a> is up on the
 Homework tab to the left.</p>
 
 <p>(2014-01-27) I've put links up on the Resources page to both practice midterms
 handed out in class today (monday Jan 27), along with solutions.</p>

 <p>(2014-01-23) I've posted partial solutions to Homework 2 under the 
 <a href="homework.html">Homework</a> tab. The solutions I've written are for those
 questions in the homework I cooked up; the rest of the answers can be found at the 
 back of Boyce.</p>
 
 <p>(2014-01-23) Links to a bunch of practice/past Midterm 1 papers are now up
 under the <a href="resources.html">Resources and Links</a> tab on the left.</p>
 
 <p>(2014-01-16) Due to the public holiday this coming Monday Jan 20,
 I'm holding extra office hours Friday Jan 17, 13:30-15:30 in my office,
 Padelford C-430. I urge everyone to look at the homework early and plan
 to come then if you need to, since you won't get the opportunity to speak
 to me about the homework on Monday.</p>

 <p>(2014-01-15) <a href="../math307_material/homeworks/HW_2.pdf">Homework 2</a> has been posted,
  due Wed 22 Jan 2014 09:30 in class.</p>

 <p>(2014-01-13) I've put up links to MATH307 course notes recently written 
 by two other UW Math instructors: <a href="../math307_material/notes/holdaway_course_notes.pdf">
 Cody Holdaway</a> and <a href="../math307_material/notes/mcmurdie_course_notes.pdf">Chris
 McMurdie</a>. Boths sets of notes cover roughly the same material as
 that seen in this course, so they're a good additional pair of resources
 to have.</p>

 <p>(2014-01-08) <a href="../math307_material/homeworks/HW_1.pdf">Homework 1</a> has been posted,
 due Wed 15 Jan 2014 09:30 in class.</p>

 <p>(2014-01-07) A number of students have approached me asking for the add code 
to the class so they can enroll. Unfortunately I'm not able to hand out add codes 
- only Math Advising may do this, and when the section is full (as it is now) they 
are unlikely to do so. 

However, many people switch sections or drop classes in the first week or two of the 
term; if you're looking to get into the class, I encourage you to monitor the
enrollment in the class online, and register through MyUW in the usual way  as soon
as a spot opens up.

Click <a href="http://www.washington.edu/students/timeschd/WIN2014/math.html">here</a>
to be taken to the math course schedule for the winter quarter. <b>NOTE: THIS PAGE
IS ONLY UPDATED AT MIDNIGHT EVERY NIGHT, SO ENROLLMENT DATA IS NOT CURRENT</b>.
However, if you then click the "Enrollment Summary" link at the top right of the page
you'll get up-to-the-minute data about enrollment in my section.</p>
 
 (2014-01-07) Links to the course calendar and homeworks are now up on the left. <br>
 (2014-01-06) Course Info sheet can be found <A HREF="course_info_sheet.pdf">here</A>. There's also a permanent link at the bottom of the page.
