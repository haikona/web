 <h2>MATH307 E&H, FALL 2014</h2>
 <br>
 <p> Hi Everyone! Welcome to MATH307, sections E & H, Fall 2014. I'll use
 this page for course announcements and to provide links to material
 mentioned in class.</p>

 <h4>Announcements:</h4>
 <p>(2014-11-14) <a href="../math307_material/resources/midterm_2/au_14_practice_spicer.pdf">Practice Midterm 2</a> is up. Try put aside 50 minutes this weekend to sit down and take the practice midterm under exam conditions. This will give you some good practice for the midterm on Wednesday, as well as giving an indication on which material you still need to review more. I will discuss the exam during the review session in class on Monday, after which I will post a full set of solutions on the website.</p>

 <p>(2014-11-14) On Wednesday I gave two equivalent formulae on the board for $\omega_{\text{max}}$, the resonant frequency (the frequency at which the forced response amplitude is maximized) in a forced oscillatory system with damping. In one of them I included an error. I had stated that $\omega_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m} - \frac{\gamma^2}{2km}}$; however, the second term under the square root sign should have a $m^2$ in the denominator instead of $km$. The correct formula for the resonant frequency is
$$ \omega_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m} - \frac{\gamma^2}{2m^2}} = \omega_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{\gamma^2}{2km}}$$
where $m$ is the mass of the object being modeled, $\gamma$ the damping constant, $k$ the spring constant, and $\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$ the natural frequency of the system.</p> 

 <p>(2014-11-05) <a href="../math307_material/homeworks/MATH307_au_14_HW_6.pdf">Homework 6</a> is up, due Wed 19 November 2014 at the beginning of class. Note: this is due in 2 weeks, not the usual 1. I've done this so I can include a variety of questions on 2nd-order modeling, all of which is testable in Midterm 2. I recommend you get started on it as soon as possible, as the homework set is correspondingly longer than usual.</p>

 <p>(2014-11-05) I've put up <a href="../math307_material/homework_solutions/MATH307_au_14_HW_5_solutions.pdf">partial solutions to Homework 5.</a></p>

 <p>(2014-11-03) Note that Tuesday 11 November is a holiday (Veteran's Day), so I'm moving my office hours for week 8 to the day before: Monday 10 November 14:00-16:00.</p>

 <p>(2014-10-29) <a href="../math307_material/homeworks/MATH307_au_14_HW_5.pdf">Homework 5</a> is up, due Wed 05 November 2014 at the beginning of class.</p>

 <p>(2014-10-22) <a href="../math307_material/homeworks/MATH307_au_14_HW_4.pdf">Homework 4</a> is up, due Wednesday October 29 at the beginning of class. I've also up <a href="../math307_material/homework_solutions/MATH307_au_14_HW_3_solutions.pdf">partial solutions to Homework 3.</a></p>

 <p>(2014-10-20) I've put up <a href="../math307_material/resources/midterm_1/au14_solutions_spicer.pdf">solutions to Midterm 1</a> and today's lecture notes on <a href = "../math307_material/notes/lecture_10a_the_wronskian.pdf">the Wronskian</a>. Please take some time to go through the midterm solutions, as understanding how to answer each question will help you in future exams.</p>

 <p>(2014-10-17) <a href="../math307_material/resources/midterm_1/au14_spicer.pdf">Link to Midterm 1</a>.</p>

 <p>(2014-10-17) <font color="red"><b>MIDTERM 1 MAKEUP GUIDELINES:</b></font><br>

 I'm allowing you to redo up to two questions of <a href="../math307_material/resources/midterm_1/au14_spicer.pdf">Midterm 1</a> as a take-home 
 assignment, <b>to be handed in Monday 20 October at the beginning of class</b>.
 If you submit one rewritten question, I will grade that question out of 10 points
 total. If you submit the solutions to two questions, I will grade each out of a
 maximum of 8 points total. These scores will then replace your existing scores for
 those respective questions, but only if your new scores are higher (I won't ever 
 adjust your score downwards).</p>

 <p>For each question to be eligible to be graded <b>you must write up full 
 solutions to all parts of that question</b>, not just the parts where you lost 
 points. This includes part b) of question 5 (even though the regrade will be for a
 maximum of 10 points). I encourage everyone who got less than full
 grade on one or more questions to submit new solutions, as it will help you become
 comfortable with the material.</p>

 <p> You are welcome to collaborate and figure out the questions' solutions in groups 
 together; if you do please acknowledge anyone you worked with in writing at 
 the top of you writeup. Furthermore, even if you collaborate with others to 
 figure out the problem solutions <b>you must write up your solutions on your own and
 in your  own words</b>; I won't accept the exact same solution copied into multiple 
 write-ups.</p>

 <p>For ease of grading, please submit your rewritten solutions on clean sheets of
 paper (i.e. don't just write on your returned midterm and hand that back in). If you
 submit multiple pages, make sure they are stapled together.</p>

 <p>Finally, because this is open book with much less time pressure, I'll be 
 grading your submissions more strictly than I did before. I urge you therefore to
 double-check your solutions for correctness.</p>

 <p>(2014-10-13) <a href="../math307_material/resources/midterm_1/au14_practice_solution_spicer.pdf">Solutions to Practice Midterm 1</a> are up.</p>

 <p>(2014-10-10) <a href="../math307_material/resources/midterm_1/au14_practice_spicer.pdf">Practice Midterm 1</a> is up. Try put aside 50 minutes this weekend to sit down and take the practice midterm under exam conditions. This will give you some good practice for the midterm on Wednesday, as well as giving an indication on which material you still need to review more. I will discuss the exam during the review session in class on Monday, after which I will post a full set of solutions on the website.</p>

 <p>(2014-10-10) I've put up <a href="../math307_material/homework_solutions/MATH307_au_14_HW_2_solutions.pdf">partial solutions to Homework 2</a>. This includes typed up solutions to the two questions not taken from Boyce that I cooked up for this homework set (i.e. the scientific knowledge and the water hyacinth questions). If you had difficulty with those questions, I recommend taking a look at their solutions, as you wan't get your Homework 2 sets back until just before the midterm next week.</p>

 <p>(2014-10-09) A reminder that Midterm 1 takes place next Wednesday October 15 during class. The work covered in the midterm is all the work covered in lectures and homeworks up to and including Friday October 10. More specifically, you are expected to know the following:
<ul>
	<li>How to solve separable first-order DEs (Boyce 2.2)</li>
	<li>How to solve linear first-order DEs (Boyce 2.1)</li>
	<li>How to solve and solve a first-order word problem (Boyce 2.3)</li>
	<li>How to determine Existence and Uniqueness (Boyce 2.4)</li>
	<li>How to interpret a slope field (Boyce 1.1)</li>
	<li>How to analyze autonomous equations qualitatively (Boyce 2.5)</li>
	<li>How to use Euler's Method (Boyce 2.7)</li>
</ul>

 You are allowed <b>one two-sided handwritten</b> notesheet to bring in to the midterm, and use of a scientific calculator. Typed notes and graphing calculators are not permitted. </p>

 <p>(2014-10-08) <a href="../math307_material/homeworks/MATH307_au_14_HW_3.pdf">Homework 3</a> is up. This is only due on October 22 (i.e. in two weeks) due to Midterm 1 on October 15.</p>

 <p>(2014-09-30) MATH307 H has been moved to <a href="http://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/low">Loew (LOW) 216</a>. The new room is is a) a bit bigger with more board space, and b) is in the same building as the section I teach the period beforehand, so I won’t arrive out of breath with no time to spare any more.<br><br>

The room change is effective immediately, so we meet in the new room from tomorrow (1 Oct) at 12:30 pm. I’ll put an announcement up outside the old classroom (THO 134); it should also be reflected in your MyUW classes homepage.
</p>

 <p>(2014-09-30) Typo in the HW 1. See <a href="homework.html">the homework page</a> for details.</p>

 <p>(2014-09-30) You are expected to show your working on any question in the homework that’s more than a little involved (the same goes for midterms and the final when you get there). The exact definition of “more than a little involved” may vary from person to person, but the rule of thumb is this: if you can’t arrive at the correct answer in your head in a few seconds, you should be writing down your working as part of the solution writeup. <font color="red"><b>The course grader and I reserve the right to dock points from your homeworks/exams if you fail to show your working in a given problem.</font></b></p>

 <p>(2014-09-26) Homework submission format clarification:
  <ul>
    <li> Homeworks are to be written or typed up and handed to me in class on
     Wednesdays. Please make sure your submissions are neat and legible, and have your
     name and student number at the top of each page.</li>
    <li> <font color="red"><b> Please staple any pages you submit together. If you
     submit more than one page for your homework and don't staple the pages together
     you will lose 2 points for that homework (out of 20 - i.e. 10%).</b></font> I
     will try to bring a stapler to class on Wednesdays, so if you forget beforehand
     you can staple your homeworks then.</li>
  </ul> 
 </p>

 <p>(2014-09-26) I wrote down the wrong name for the course textbook in class. We are
 using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elementary-Differential-Equations-William-Boyce/dp/0470458321/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1411744785&sr=1-1&keywords=elementary+differential+equations+10th+edition">Elementary Differential Equations</a> by Boyce
 and DiPrima, 10th Edition (not "Introduction to Differential Equations" as I had
 written it).</p>

 <p>(2014-09-23) <a href="../math307_material/homeworks/MATH307_au_14_HW_1.pdf">Homework 1</a> has been posted,
 due Wed 1 Oct 2014 at the beginning of class.</p>

 <p>(2014-09-16) Here's a link to the <A HREF="../math307_material/resources/math307_au14_info_sheet.pdf">course syllabus and info sheet</A>. A permanent link can also be found on the Resources and Links tab to the left.</p>

 <p>(2014-09-15) Welcome Everyone! If you're reading this, you've arrived at the course
  website early. Congrats on being proactive. Feel free to look around; I'll add more
  as the term progresses. I've taught this course once before; the website for that course
  can be found <a href="teaching/math307wi14/index.html">here</a>. You'll find links to old
  homeworks, notes etc.</p>
