 <h2>MATH307 E&H, FALL 2014</h2>
 <br>
 <p> Hi Everyone! Welcome to MATH307, sections E & H, Fall 2014. I'll use
 this page for course announcements and to provide links to material
 mentioned in class.</p>

 <h4>Announcements:</h4>

 <p>(2014-10-13) <a href="../math307_material/resources/midterm_1/au14_practice_solution_spicer.pdf">Solutions to Practice Midterm 1</a> are up.</p>

 <p>(2014-10-10) <a href="../math307_material/resources/midterm_1/au14_practice_spicer.pdf">Practice Midterm 1</a> is up. Try put aside 50 minutes this weekend to sit down and take the practice midterm under exam conditions. This will give you some good practice for the midterm on Wednesday, as well as giving an indication on which material you still need to review more. I will discuss the exam during the review session in class on Monday, after which I will post a full set of solutions on the website.</p>

 <p>(2014-10-10) I've put up <a href="../math307_material/homework_solutions/HW_2_solutions.pdf">partial solutions to Homework 2</a>. This includes typed up solutions to the two questions not taken from Boyce that I cooked up for this homework set (i.e. the scientific knowledge and the water hyacinth questions). If you had difficulty with those questions, I recommend taking a look at their solutions, as you wan't get your Homework 2 sets back until just before the midterm next week.</p>

 <p>(2014-10-09) A reminder that Midterm 1 takes place next Wednesday October 15 during class. The work covered in the midterm is all the work covered in lectures and homeworks up to and including Friday October 10. More specifically, you are expected to know the following:
<ul>
	<li>How to solve separable first-order DEs (Boyce 2.2)</li>
	<li>How to solve linear first-order DEs (Boyce 2.1)</li>
	<li>How to solve and solve a first-order word problem (Boyce 2.3)</li>
	<li>How to determine Existence and Uniqueness (Boyce 2.4)</li>
	<li>How to interpret a slope field (Boyce 1.1)</li>
	<li>How to analyze autonomous equations qualitatively (Boyce 2.5)</li>
	<li>How to use Euler's Method (Boyce 2.7)</li>
</ul>

 You are allowed <b>one two-sided handwritten</b> notesheet to bring in to the midterm, and use of a scientific calculator. Typed notes and graphing calculators are not permitted. </p>

 <p>(2014-10-08) <a href="../math307_material/homeworks/MATH307_au_14_HW_3.pdf">Homework 3</a> is up. This is only due on October 22 (i.e. in two weeks) due to Midterm 1 on October 15.</p>

 <p>(2014-09-30) MATH307 H has been moved to <a href="http://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/low">Loew (LOW) 216</a>. The new room is is a) a bit bigger with more board space, and b) is in the same building as the section I teach the period beforehand, so I won’t arrive out of breath with no time to spare any more.<br><br>

The room change is effective immediately, so we meet in the new room from tomorrow (1 Oct) at 12:30 pm. I’ll put an announcement up outside the old classroom (THO 134); it should also be reflected in your MyUW classes homepage.
</p>

 <p>(2014-09-30) Typo in the HW 1. See <a href="homework.html">the homework page</a> for details.</p>

 <p>(2014-09-30) You are expected to show your working on any question in the homework that’s more than a little involved (the same goes for midterms and the final when you get there). The exact definition of “more than a little involved” may vary from person to person, but the rule of thumb is this: if you can’t arrive at the correct answer in your head in a few seconds, you should be writing down your working as part of the solution writeup. <font color="red"><b>The course grader and I reserve the right to dock points from your homeworks/exams if you fail to show your working in a given problem.</font></b></p>

 <p>(2014-09-26) Homework submission format clarification:
  <ul>
    <li> Homeworks are to be written or typed up and handed to me in class on
     Wednesdays. Please make sure your submissions are neat and legible, and have your
     name and student number at the top of each page.</li>
    <li> <font color="red"><b> Please staple any pages you submit together. If you
     submit more than one page for your homework and don't staple the pages together
     you will lose 2 points for that homework (out of 20 - i.e. 10%).</b></font> I
     will try to bring a stapler to class on Wednesdays, so if you forget beforehand
     you can staple your homeworks then.</li>
  </ul> 
 </p>

 <p>(2014-09-26) I wrote down the wrong name for the course textbook in class. We are
 using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elementary-Differential-Equations-William-Boyce/dp/0470458321/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1411744785&sr=1-1&keywords=elementary+differential+equations+10th+edition">Elementary Differential Equations</a> by Boyce
 and DiPrima, 10th Edition (not "Introduction to Differential Equations" as I had
 written it).</p>

 <p>(2014-09-23) <a href="../math307_material/homeworks/MATH307_au_14_HW_1.pdf">Homework 1</a> has been posted,
 due Wed 1 Oct 2014 at the beginning of class.</p>

 <p>(2014-09-16) Here's a link to the <A HREF="../math307_material/resources/math307_au14_info_sheet.pdf">course syllabus and info sheet</A>. A permanent link can also be found on the Resources and Links tab to the left.</p>

 <p>(2014-09-15) Welcome Everyone! If you're reading this, you've arrived at the course
  website early. Congrats on being proactive. Feel free to look around; I'll add more
  as the term progresses. I've taught this course once before; the website for that course
  can be found <a href="teaching/math307wi14/index.html">here</a>. You'll find links to old
  homeworks, notes etc.</p>
