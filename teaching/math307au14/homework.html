 <h3>Errata</h3>
 
 <h4>Homework 1, Question 1 (c):</h4>
 <p>This question asks you to use partial fractions to compute an integral). The numerator should read $x-2$, not $x-2$. To avoid integrating over poles I've also changed the bounds of integration to $-1$ to $2$. Thus the question now asks you to use partial fractions to compute
$$ \int_{-1}^2 \frac{x-2}{x^2-3x-10}\; dx $$
[If the numerator is $x+2$ the integrand actually simplifies to $\frac{1}{x-5}$, which you can integrate without needing partial fractions - not very interesting]. The <a href="../math307_material/homeworks/MATH307_au_14_HW_1.pdf">HW 1 problem set PDF</a> has been duly updated to reflect this change.</p>

<p>Since I caught this typo fairly late, we won't penalize you if you compute the original integral. The main thing to remember here is how to use partial fractions to compute integrals of rational functions.
</p>

 <h3>Homework Grading Scheme:</h3>

 <p>There are a total of 7 weekly homework sets for this course. The six best scores
 will be counted toward your final grade; your lowest homework score will be dropped.
 I have a strict no late submissions policy for the homework. Requests for extensions
 will only be considered if submitted in writing (i.e. handwritten note or email)
 at least two hours before the homework due date and time, and will generally only
 be given in cases of medical or physical duress.</p>

 <p>Each homework set will be graded out of 20 points. 
 Because the course grader is only employed for a maximum of
 4 hours a week, given the class size it's unfeasible to have every
 homework question graded fully. 
 Thus a few questions will be randomly selected from the homework
 each week and those will be graded fully; this usually comprises
 about 10-12 points total. The balance of the points will be awarded
 for full completion of the homework set.</p>

 <p>Hopefully this will provide decent feedback on your progress in
 the course and incentivize you to complete each homework set fully,
 given the constraints of the grader's contract.</p>
